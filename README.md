Markdown converter to FreeBSD style syntax

## Requirements
* xclip

## Usage

## TODO
* Update the above section.
* Currently multiple traversals are being used for replacement. A better approach would be to replace everything in a single traversal.
* A vim plugin doing in place conversion would also be good.
